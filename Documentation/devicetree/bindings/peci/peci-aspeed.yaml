      Message timing negotiation period. This value will determine the period

      of address timing negotiation to be issued by PECI controller. The unit

  rd-sampling-point:
    description: |
      Read sampling point selection. The whole period of a bit time will be
      divided into 16 time frames. This value will determine the time frame
      in which the controller will sample PECI signal for data read back.
      Usually in the middle of a bit time is the best.
