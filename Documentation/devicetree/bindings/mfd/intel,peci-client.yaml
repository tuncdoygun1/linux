description: |
  PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) is a one-wire bus interface
  that provides a communication channel from PECI clients in Intel processors
  and chipset components to external monitoring or control devices. PECI is
  designed to support the following sideband functions:
  - Processor and DRAM thermal management
  - Platform Manageability
  - Processor Interface Tuning and Diagnostics
  - Failure Analysis

properties:
  compatible:
    const: intel,peci-client

      addresses start from 0x30.
